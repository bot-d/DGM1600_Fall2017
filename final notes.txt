not sure i wanna continue trying to create branches and merging, i may need some help with that area and refresh on the way it is actually performed. 
-also i think i need a few more commits to finish up so lets go above and beyond! 
-this whole thing is really hard sometimes but i really want to follow my dreams so I’m not giving up…
-well, that and I’ve put a butt load of money into these classes so commitment has already been initiated. 

-that was close i almost forgot to push some of these final notes to chumbawumba

-is this at all what you expected me to write?
