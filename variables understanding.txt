//Variables are the like a capsule from dragon ball z. The reasoning behind this is that inside it just as any container, it holds what is inside, in a video game it could be a power-up, ammo, health, anything.
//Variables can be locked, this lock would be listing the variable as, "private." Or you can unlock it by listing it, "public" here's an example below
    
    private int ammo = "5" 

//furthermore, if you do not specify wether the variable is private or public, the default sets it to private, like this.

	int ammoPack = “5”

//if we want to make the variable a portion of something, like a health bar or mana, then we must use the appropriate kind of variable, in this case, “float,” which defines the perameters of the variable, defining the percentage. for example….

	public healthbar float = .5f

//there are other kinds of variables too, one of such is int which we used before, this variable does the opposite of float, it defines only whole numbers a.k.a., “integers.”
 
	public int grenades = 10

//Lastly we have a “string,” which simply includes data, words, information, etc.

	public string “this assignments now complete…. maybe not perfect at all…. but complete.”
